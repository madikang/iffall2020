        <p> 1. My name is Madi Kang. I am a Communication Design major, and I am a junior.</p>
        <p> 2. Web development is a skill I am really interested in learning not only because I want to 
            expand my skillset as a designer, but also because I've always wanted to learn in general. I 
            also think web development is an important skill to have, in both technical and design 
            perspectives, because the world now essentially revolves around screens and technology.
        </p>
        <p> 3. As a Computer Science minor, I have learned JavaScript in some courses. In addition, I have
            taken a Sam Fox course called Sculpting Realities, where I worked with HTML and Aframe in making
            VR and AR. 
        </p>
        <p> 4. I am looking forward to learning more HTML, as my knowledge of it is very basic. I also look
            forward to learning and exploring how people interact with information on screens and applying 
            that knowledge to my own work.
        </p>
        <p> 5. I think designing for a screen will be different from designing for paper because of the difference
            between the ways people view a physical container of information and a digital container of information. 
            In a paper or a book, a person holds all the information available in their hands and can easily 
            navigate the content or even mark information. On a digital screen, a user navigates based on how content
            is divided and how easily accessible the information is to the user's eye. 
        </p>
        <p> 6. I think <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/">Pinterest</a> has an effective design because it 
        is formatted to look as though images are pinned to a bulletin board. Browsing the site gives the user
        that sense of a real life board, except it's endless. Pinterest also does a good job of making the 
        content the main component of the site by emphasizing organization, suggesting things the user might
        like, and encouraging browsing new images. The website emphasizes finding ideas and inspiration by 
        making a real life scenario of "pinning" pictures into something spacially efficient and easy to navigate.</p>
        <p> 7. I think the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox website</a> exemplifies effective communication. 
        The purpose of Dropbox is to store and organize files. Dropbox easily communicates the actions and organization 
        options. It presents the options very plainly, conveying that storing files is simple and direct.   </p>
        <p> 8. I think <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">AirBNB</a> is a website that works well. Its functions
        are presented with an eye-catching hierarchy-- with the search bar the most prominent. It also works well
        in encouraging and suggesting other options below the main search function. The page has a hierarchy that
        firstmost emphasizes searching for a place to stay, then goes on to show a variety of functions that encourage
        the user to continue to search for an airbnb.</p>
